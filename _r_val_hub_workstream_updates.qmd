### Reminder: News within the last year
  
- The FDA appears to accept `.R` files through their eSUB portal[^esub].
- The FDA has released a draft of a new _Computer Software Assurance[^csa]_ guideline
  that seems to be increasingly the basis for their evaluation of R.

### Analyzing change in assessed risk across package releases 

> The Software Open Source (SOS) team manages and executes the risk assessment process for R package validation at Novartis. The team uses an internally developed R package to classify the risk of each package as "low", "medium", or "high".
> 
> We analysed the risk assessment data over two time points to determine the impact on the assigned risk categorisation for packages with AND without version changes. 
> 
> In this talk, we showcase the risk assessments over time, the causes of any risk class changes, and  their impact on various teams within our organizations as a result.

## ![](resources/riskassessment.png){height="1.8em" width="1.8em" style="margin: 0 0.2em; object-fit: contain;vertical-align: middle;"} `{riskassessment}` App

### Latest Features Recap

* Expanded decision automation to include individual {riskmetric} assessment values
* New `Function Explorer` page and faster exploration of source code
* Expanded the package dependency view
* Miscellaneous items
  
The feedback loop is crucial! All of these improvements started off as community-driven suggestions on our GitHub repo. If you have an idea that doesn't already exist on the [existing list](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues) of issues, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues/new) today and it may become a reality tomorrow.

### Big changes
Running from risk scores & focusing solely on metric assessments

::: { style="font-size:0.8em" }
- **Ease of use:**  
  Wrapper functions for a a complete workflow, prettier outputs
- **Metric completeness:**  
  Implement metrics for as many pacakge sources as possible. Chain sources 
  together to create more complete assessments
- **Modular additions:**  
  Allow users to easy add custom assessments, create optional assessments 
  based on community packages (e.g. `oyster`, `srr`, `pkgstats`, etc)
- **Focusing on metrics and scoring:**  
  Making custom weighting more robust and convenient. Guidance materials on 
  weighting specific assessments based on community feedback and our own views 
  on best practices.
