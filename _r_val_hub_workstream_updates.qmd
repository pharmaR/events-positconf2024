## 🗝 Key Policy Updates!

- R Submissions Working group Pioneering use of Containers for delivering
  study analysis with positive health authority feedback.[^pharmasug]

### Reminder: News within the last year
  
- The FDA appears to accept `.R` files through their eSUB portal[^esub].
- The FDA has released a draft of a new _Computer Software Assurance[^csa]_ guideline
  that seems to be increasingly the basis for their evaluation of R.

#### Commonalities

- Categorized risk (hi/med/lo)
- Heavily weight unit testing
- Base & Suggested packages "trusted"
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
#### Differences

- Risk stratification (eg coverage cutoff)
- Managing risk
  - human-in-the-middle review 
  - restricted package subset
  - adding bespoke testing

## Community Meetings

- Next date: 🗓️ Aug 20, 2024

- Speaker: 👷‍♂️ Bríd Roberts, Novartis [how do I change this icon to female?]

- Topic:

### Measuring change in assessed risk across package releases 

> The Software Open Source (SOS) team manages and executes the risk assessment process for R package validation at Novartis. The team uses an internally developed R package to classify the risk of each package as "low", "medium", or "high".
> 
> We analysed the risk assessment data over two time points to determine the impact on the assigned risk categorisation for packages with AND without version changes. 
> 
> In this talk, we showcase the risk assessments over time, the causes of any risk class changes, and  their impact on various teams within our organizations as a result.

::: { style="font-size:0.8em" }
- **Ease of use:**  
  Wrapper functions for a a complete workflow, prettier outputs
- **Metric completeness:**  
  Implement metrics for as many pacakge sources as possible. Chain sources 
  together to create more complete assessments
- **Modular addititions:**  
  Allow users to easy add custom assessments, create optional assessments 
  based on community packages (e.g. `oyster`, `srr`, `pkgstats`, etc)
- **Focusing on metrics and scoring:**  
  Making custom weighting more robust and convenient. Guidance materials on 
  weighting specific assessments based on community feedback and our own views 
  on best practices.
